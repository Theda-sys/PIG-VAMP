Abstract: Research into probiotic use in pregnancy typically focuses on general probiotic strains. 
We instead investigated the relation between intake of ice cream with vaginal commensal probiotics 
(L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, L. rhamnosus GR-1; these govern a stable microbiota and carry 
beneficial functions in the vagina), throughout pregnancy, and the impact on gut and vaginal microbiomes, 
in women at high risk of preterm birth. This was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR. In total 43
pregnant women were randomized, with 29 assigned to the intervention group and 14 to the control group. Both groups 
provided vaginal and rectal swabs by self-sampling at gestational time points. Pregnancy outcomes were registered 
through hospital records, and ice cream compliance and study experience was recorded. We observe gut and vaginal Lactobacillus 
increase during first half of pregnancy in all women with a further increase in the second half in women compliant with the 
intervention. L. crispatus was found more often in the intervention group, and L. gasseri, L. jensenii and L. rhamnosus GR-1 in the 
ice cream could be recovered in both rectal and vaginal samples. Finally, vaginal Prevotella spp, as well as gut Gardnerella and Atopobium spp,
significantly decreased from the intervention. We conclude that vaginal commensal probiotics administered as a synbiotic in ice cream can be 
an effective method of optimizing the vaginal and intestinal health in pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth when administered regularly.
